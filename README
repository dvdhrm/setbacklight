There is an in-kernel driver named "samsung-laptop" that supports proper
samsung-ABIs instead of messing with PCI-states.

Please see ./drivers/platform/x86/samsung-laptop.c in current kernel tree for
this driver.

This repository is obsolete and no longer udpated nor bugfixed. It's only
available for documentational purposes.

= Samsung N210 Backlight Driver =
  This application allows to set the backlight of the Samsung N210 to a
  user-supplied brightness value. This application takes as argument a
  brightness value and sets the current brightness to that value.
  Run the application without arguments to get usage information. It is
  also possible to retrieve the current brightness value.

  This application uses internally:
    /usr/sbin/setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=ff
  Whereas "ff" is the brightness value to set.
  This command is not specific to the Samsung N210 netbook, but it is known
  to work there. You may use this driver with any other computer and adjust
  the binary-path, bus-address and register-address on compile time.

= Install =
  compilation: make
  clean: make clean
  install: make install (this installs with SETUID bit into /usr/bin)
  uninstall: make uninstall (this removes /usr/bin/setbacklight)

= Security Considerations =
  When installed with SETUID bit as root, this program, when invoked, passes
  control to /usr/sbin/setpci with root-rights so you should go sure that
  the binary located there cannot be modified by possible attackers and must
  be the GNU setpci utility.

  This driver is written from scratch. Use it at your own risk.

= Library =
  The driver.h and driver.c files implement a clean driver API for the brightness
  regulation. You may use these files to access the backlight in your own application.
  However, it is recommended to compile the main.c application and use the command line
  interface to access the backlight.
