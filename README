= Samsung N210 Backlight Driver =
  This application allows to set the backlight of the Samsung N210 to a
  user-supplied brightness value. This application takes as argument a
  brightness value and sets the current brightness to that value.
  Run the application without arguments to get usage information.

  This application uses internally:
    setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=ff
  Whereas "ff" is the brightness value to set.
  This command is not specific to the Samsung N210 netbook, but it is known
  to work there. You may use this driver with any other computer and adjust
  the bus-address and register-address either on compile-time or run-time.

= Install =
  compilation: make
  clean: make clean
  install: make install (this installs with SETUID bit into /usr/bin)
  uninstall: make uninstall (this removes /usr/bin/setbacklight)

  This driver is written from scratch. Use it at your own risk.

= Library =
  The driver.h and driver.c files implement a clean driver API for the brightness
  regulation. You may use these files to access the usblamps in your own application.
  However, it is recommended to compile the main.c application and use the command line
  interface to access the backlight.
